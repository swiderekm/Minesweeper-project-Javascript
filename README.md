# Minesweeper-project-Javascript
Minesweeper based on original minesweeper. Made as a Diploma Project for NTI upper secondary school in Stockholm

Game was created without my previous bigger knowledge on javascript, though I studied mostly PHP and C#.
The project was really fun and most important of all it works.

Today my javascript and overall programming knowledge has skyrocketed.
